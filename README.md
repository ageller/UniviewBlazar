# UniviewBlazar
A simple 3D model of a blazar in Maya and imported to Uniview (meant to be TXS 0506+056, which sent a neutrino observed as IceCube-170922A) for use in the Adler's 2018 Fall Kavli Lecture.

The 3D model is stored on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sD2VnE3MS2FT9xcE7LgXiyvnLeSyMRpf?usp=sharing).  There are various versions, but the current one is:

* BlazarSolidModel_v2.2.obj
* BlazarSolidModel_v2.2.mtl

You will need to download both of these files and place them in the data directory.
